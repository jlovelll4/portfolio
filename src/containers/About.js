        Hey there! Thank you for checking out my site. This is an exciting time
        for me. I am transitioning from a career in Geospatial Analysis to
        pursue an exciting career in the tech industry. More accurately, I am
        working to fuse my geospatial / GIS background with my newly acquired
        coding skills. My desire is to build applications that take advantage of
        data and spatial analysis to provide solutions that positively impact
        the world.
